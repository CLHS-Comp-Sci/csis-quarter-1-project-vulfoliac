### 2025-26 CLHS Computer Science Independent Study
Ezra David Sanderson

## Targeted Topic or Skill
I'm focusing on improving code organization, web development, and API interactions.

## Description
The project is a firefox Add-On that provides the user of a consolidated list of all streamers they follow, automatically opens favorited streams, and notifies them of streams who go live. 
_Project purpose including inputs/algorithm/outputs_

## Defense
The application functioning will prove that I familiarized myself with APIs and the repository will reflect my efforts to maintain organized code.

## Technical
I used Visual Studio Code for development; it was developed entirely using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a JSON file; it contains 5 seperate files and no applications.

## Use
_Insert directions for how to use your project and any command line dependencies and arguments. Think of this section as more of a instruction manual_

## Sources
_Insert and sources used for research here_
