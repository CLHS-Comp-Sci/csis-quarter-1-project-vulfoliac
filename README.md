# CSIS-quarterly-project

# Stream Helper
### 2025-26 CLHS Computer Science Independent Study
Ezra David Sanderson

## Targeted Topic or Skill
I'm focusing on improving code organization, web development, and API interactions.

## Description
The project is a firefox Add-On that provides the user of a consolidated list of all streamers they follow, automatically opens favorited streams, and notifies them of streams who go live. 

## Defense
The application functioning will prove that I familiarized myself with APIs and the repository will reflect my efforts to maintain organized code.

## Technical
I used Visual Studio Code for development; it was developed entirely using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a JSON file; it contains 5 seperate files and no applications.

## Use
The application is currently not approved or pending for approval as a firefox addon or google application. To use it you need to download all the files, add them to a folder, open about:debugging as a new tab in your firefox browser, navigate to the add-ons, import the add-on using the manifest.json file. Open the new add-on and sign in to either Twitch, YouTube, or both. You will now be provided an updated list of everyone you follow on whatever platforms you are signed into when you open the add-on.

## Steps and Progress 
- [X] Use github to keep track of code sometimes
- [X] Determine a proffesional IDE or applications/materials used
- [X] Research and gather relevant background knowledge 
- [X] Create step by step process of checklist items needed to complete project
- [X] Code and Create Project following your given steps
- [X] Create a manifest.json to allow you to use the program as a firefox extension
- [X] Add a main .html and css files that open a window called Livestream Lurker called by the manifest
- [X] Create logic for checking whether or not a streamer is live given a list of all streamers/channels followed
